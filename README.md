# Semiconductor Yield Analytics Dashboard 

This repository contains a **Streamlit dashboard** for monitoring and analyzing semiconductor wafer yield and process parameters.

---

## Features

- **Overall Yield Performance**: Tracks wafer yield over time.
- **Process Analysis (Etch)**: Visualizes etch process parameters (pressure, duration) vs yield.
- **Failure Analysis**: Identifies and counts failure reasons.
